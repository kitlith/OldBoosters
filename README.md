## Features
 - The booster bug can be turned on an off on a per-minecart basis.
 - ~~There's a config setting to change what newly placed minecarts are.~~
   - This is not currently true, as config is not implemented in the port.
   - You can bypass the ~~setting~~ default by using an NBT tag, e.g. `/summon minecraft:minecart ~ ~ ~ {EnableBoosters: true/false}`
